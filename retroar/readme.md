# Club Day Poster

This is the source code for the AR experience available on the poster we had during the Fall 2023 Club Day, on the Developer's Guild table.

The experience utilizes [MindAR](https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/), an augmented reality library that allows creating image tracked and face tracked AR experience with only one HTML file.

*targets.mind* is a compiled file containing tracking information about the original poster, which enables the code to track the poster. it was created using [this tool](https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile)

*Epic Hango.hlb* is a 3D model for the pseudo Windows 95 pop up that appears 8 seconds after the poster is detected for the first time.

*capybara.hlb* is a 3D model of a capybara.

*index.html* is the HTML file that contains the entire AR experience. More information about it is available inside the file, where I tried to comment as much as possible.

Here is the poster in case you want to try the AR experience. It works best when printed:
